## 🎯 BETTING STRATEGIES

### Conservative Strategy

**Goal:** Minimize risk, steady small wins

**Approach:**
- Small bet amounts (₹1000-₹2500)
- Alternate between sides
- Use REBET for winning patterns
- Don't chase losses

**Example Session:**
```
Round 1: ₹1000 Andar → Win ₹2000 (+₹1000)
Round 2: ₹1000 Bahar → Lose (Andar won)
Round 3: ₹1000 Andar → Win ₹2000 (+₹1000)
Net: +₹1000 profit
```

### Aggressive Strategy

**Goal:** Big wins, higher risk

**Approach:**
- Larger bet amounts (₹5000-₹10000)
- Use 2X when confident
- Follow winning side
- Set stop-loss limit

**Example Session:**
```
Round 1: ₹5000 Andar → Win ₹10000 (+₹5000)
Round 2: ₹10000 Andar → Lose (Bahar won)
Round 3: ₹5000 Bahar → Win ₹10000 (+₹5000)
Net: +₹5000 profit (but volatile)
```

### Balanced Strategy (Recommended)

**Goal:** Mix of safety and opportunity

**Approach:**
- Medium bets (₹2500-₹5000)
- Split bets across both sides
- Use UNDO for mistakes
- Use 2X sparingly

**Example Session:**
```
Round 1: ₹2500 Andar + ₹2500 Bahar → One side wins
Round 2: REBET previous → Consistent approach
Round 3: Increase winner side by 50%
Net: Steady growth with risk management
```

### Tips for All Strategies

1. **Set a Budget**
   - Decide max spending before playing
   - Never exceed your limit
   - Walk away when reached

2. **Understand Payouts**
   - Round 1 Bahar = refund only
   - Round 2 Bahar = mixed payout
   - Round 3+ = equal payouts

3. **Track Your Progress**
   - Use game history
   - Note winning patterns
   - Learn from losses

4. **Stay Disciplined**
